<b>Gameplay</b> \n
Turn Overview

Players take turns performing one of the following actions:

Take Gem Tokens:

Take three different gem tokens, or

Take two gem tokens of the same type (if there are at least four tokens of that type available), or

Take one gold token (wildcard).

Reserve a Card:

Reserve a Development card from the tableau or the top of any deck and take a gold token. You may have up to three reserved cards.

Purchase a Development Card:

Buy a Development card from the tableau or from your reserved cards by paying the cost in gem tokens and place it in front of you.

Development cards may give you gem bonuses, which reduce the cost of future cards.

Claim a Noble Tile:

At the end of your turn, if you meet the requirements on a Noble tile, claim it to gain additional prestige points.

Level I Cards: Cost fewer gems, provide lower prestige points and gem bonuses.

Level II Cards: Cost more gems, provide moderate prestige points and gem bonuses.

Level III Cards: Cost the most gems, provide the highest prestige points and gem bonuses.

Noble Requirements: Collect specific sets of gem bonuses to claim Noble tiles, which provide additional prestige points.
